## Description
solana-tokens-api is an API that allows you to check if the POLIS DAO token exists in a given Solana address. To use this API, you need to set up the server using Express, which will run locally on localhost. An example endpoint for checking the token is provided at `localhost:3000/gabsAPI/solanaAddress`. The API utilizes Axios, so make sure to install it by running `npm install axios` before using the API. Enjoy! ;)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/solana-tokens-api.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage
1. Make sure you have set up the server using Express:
```javascript
// Add this code to your project
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();

// Define the API route
app.get('/gabsAPI/:solanaAddress', async (req, res) => {
  const solanaAddress = req.params.solanaAddress;
  
  // Your logic to check if the POLIS DAO token exists at the given Solana address
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`https://example-api.com/solana/${solanaAddress}`);
    // Process the response and check if the POLIS DAO token exists
    const polisDaoTokenExists = response.data.exists;
    
    // Return the result as JSON
    res.json({ exists: polisDaoTokenExists });
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors here
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong' });
  }
});

// Start the server on localhost:3000
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```
//
Run the project: npm start
API Endpoint
To check if the POLIS DAO token exists at a specific Solana address, make a GET request to the following endpoint:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:3000/gabsAPI/solanaAddress
Replace solanaAddress in the endpoint with the actual Solana address you want to check.

The API will return a JSON response with the exists field, indicating whether the token exists or not.

Dependencies
Express
Axios
Make sure to install these dependencies using npm install before running the API.
